# Portfolio React - v2

This is my new personal portfolio, fully coded by myself without any templates.  
Its purpose is to showcase my applications, projects, and templates as a React.js developer.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

To create a minimalist, clean, and responsive portfolio, free of unnecessary dependencies.  
Focus is entirely on projects â€” no rÃ©sumÃ©, no blog.

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rqmba/portfolio2-July2025.git
cd portfolio2-July2025
npm install
npm start
