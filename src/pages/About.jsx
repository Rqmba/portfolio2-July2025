        I'm Vong Jordan, a junior React.js developer based in France. I hold a
        professional web developer certification obtained in 2024, and I've
        chosen to continue learning on my own to specialize in the React.js
        ecosystem. I create both templates and full applications as part of my
        continuous learning journey. My goal: to sharpen my skills, build solid
        expertise, and eventually put my projects to use for clients or real
        users.
